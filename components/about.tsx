    After navigating through the uncertainties of life, I found my calling in the world of web development and programming, thanks to the guidance of my <a href="https://heidipun.com/" target="_blank" className="text-sky-600">sister</a>â€”an industry veteran. I embarked on a journey of learning, diving into courses, coding bootcamps and doing projects.
    I started with basics of web development spending time doing websites and debugging silly amateur mistakes. Later i got into Next.js, TypeScript, React, and the exciting world of full-stack development.
    <span className="italic"> Crafting the finished product, designing, and making things work seamlessly</span> are the facets of programming that fuel my passion. The satisfaction of completing a project is my favorite reward.
    My toolkit includes React, TypeScript, Next.js and backend technologies as MongoDB, Appwrite and more enabling me to bring ideas to reality.
    I am on a mission to become a <span className="font-medium">full-time full-stack web-developer</span>, driven by the desire to contribute my skills to projects and embrace the challenges of the tech world.

    <span className="italic">Beyond coding, my interests diversify into day trading, exploring new programming libraries, and delving into the realms of psychology.</span><br />
